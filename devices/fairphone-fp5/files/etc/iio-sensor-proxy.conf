# iio-sensor-proxy configuration for Fairphone 5
# Enables automatic screen rotation and ambient light sensing in GNOME

[Orientation]
# Use libssc to access the orientation sensor via ADSP
# The orientation sensor data comes from SSC (Sensor Service Client)
#
# For Qualcomm platforms with libssc, the sensors are exposed via
# the sns_client interface rather than IIO directly

[AmbientLight]
# Enable ambient light sensor for automatic brightness
