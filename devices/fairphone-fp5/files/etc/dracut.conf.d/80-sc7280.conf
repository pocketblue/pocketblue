# SC7280/QCM6490-specific dracut configuration
#
# Note: Many Qualcomm drivers are now built-in to the kernel (=y) rather than
# modules (=m). Dracut's add_drivers only affects loadable modules, so built-in
# drivers don't need to be listed here. They're included for documentation and
# in case the kernel config changes.

# Modules needed for early boot display and input (from pmaports modules-initfs)
# These enable display output and touchscreen during initramfs (e.g., for disk unlock)
