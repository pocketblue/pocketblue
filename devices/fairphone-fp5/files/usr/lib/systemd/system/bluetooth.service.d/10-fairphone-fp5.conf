# Ensure bluetooth starts after the WCN6750 HCI device is available.
# The BT serdev driver downloads firmware during early boot and registers
# hci0. We want bluetoothd to start only after this is complete.

# WCN6750 BT workaround: give the HCI device extra time after firmware
# download to complete post-setup initialization. The "unexpected event
# for opcode 0xfc48" seen during setup can delay readiness.
